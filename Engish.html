                                <p>He came to my house, which was where  my momma’s party was , on Saturday May 9th, 2015. We had so much fun but then we had an argument. At the end of the night, despite the argument we were eating, laughing, and dancing. Then on May 10th on Mother’s Day, they called my momma and said  my Uncle Carl was unresponsive and was about to be taken to the hospital. The ambulance came and pronounced him dead. 
Then we went to my grandmas  house and everybody was crying. His funeral was on May 18th, 2015. I told myself I wasn’t going to cry but I just couldn’t hold it in anymore. I couldn’t believe he was gone and that I was just with him the day before he died. It  hurt me because they were in Las Vegas. So that’s was why I took it so hard. I noticed my grandma was more calm in the beginning more than anything. So I was happy that she was calm but when it finally hit her that’s when I became sad. I was trying to stay as strong as I can for my grandma and my momma. Which meant I had to do what I  had to regardless what the case was. They needed my help with cooking, planning, and serving people. 
It changed me because my uncle always told me, “Niece, you can do it, just get good grades and be nice”. His advice helped me control my attitude because he always to want me to be positive and treat other people with respect. My behavior has improved also on some days I will have a bad day but all I got to do is think of my uncle.
